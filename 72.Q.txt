✅ Problem 2: Profit & Loss — Marked Price Strategy
Problem Statement

A store in the US sells a laptop with:

Cost Price (CP): $800

The shopkeeper wants a 25% profit

He also wants to give customers a 10% discount on Marked Price (MP)

Question

What should the Marked Price (MP) be so that after giving the 10% discount, the shopkeeper still earns a 25% profit?

Solution Approach

Let MP = x

After discount = 0.9x

Selling Price must be:
SP = CP × (1 + Profit%)
SP = 800 × 1.25 = $1000

So:
0.9x = 1000
x = 1000 / 0.9 = $1111.11
