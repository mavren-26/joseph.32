Problem 2: Fractional Knapsack Problem
Problem Statement

Given N items, each with a weight and value, and a knapsack with maximum weight W, maximize the total value you can carry. You can take fractions of items.

Input:

N = number of items

Arrays value[] and weight[]

Maximum weight W

Output:

Maximum value possible (can be fractional)


Input: value = [60, 100, 120], weight = [10, 20, 30], W = 50
Output: 240.0
Explanation: Take full items 2 and 3, and 1/2 of item 1
