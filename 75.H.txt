✅ Problem 2: Longest Consecutive Sequence
Problem Statement

You are given an array nums.
Find the length of the longest consecutive sequence of integers that can be formed using elements from the array (in any order).

You must solve it in O(n) using a hash set.

Constraints

0 <= nums.length <= 10^5

-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Example
Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation:
Longest consecutive sequence = [1,2,3,4]
