✅ Problem 1: Insert Words into a Trie & Search a Word
Description:

Implement a Trie with 2 operations:

insert(word)

search(word) → returns true if word exists in trie

Example:

Insert: ["apple", "app", "apt"]
Search "app" → true

Each character is a node.
A boolean marks the end of a word.

Not matching only prefixes

This is the simplest Trie problem.
