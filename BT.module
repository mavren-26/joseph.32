⭐ Backtracking Explained (Like You're 5)

Backtracking = try → go forward → if stuck → go back → try another option.

Think of it like:

👉 You're solving a maze.
👉 You choose a path.
👉 If you hit a dead end, you backtrack — go back to the last junction and try a new direction.

In code:

Choose something

Explore deeper

Undo the choice

Try next option

This is used for:
✔ subsets
✔ permutations
✔ combinations
✔ N-Queens
✔ solving puzzles (Sudoku, Word Search)

The key line is the undo step.
