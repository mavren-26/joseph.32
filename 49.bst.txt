🧩 Problem 2: Validate Binary Search Tree

Concepts: Inorder traversal, recursion, range checking
Statement:
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid BST.
A valid BST means for every node:

left.val < root.val < right.val


for all nodes in the left and right subtrees.

Example:
Input: root = [2,1,3]  
Output: true
