✅ Problem 1: Find the Two Unique Numbers

Given an array where:

Every number appears twice,

Except two numbers which appear only once,
Find those two unique numbers using bit manipulation.

Example:

Input:
[4,1,2,1,2,5]
Output:
[4,5] (order doesn’t matter)

🔥 Bit Trick:

XOR of all elements = A ^ B (where A,B are unique)

Find rightmost set bit to split array into two groups

XOR groups separately → gives A and B
