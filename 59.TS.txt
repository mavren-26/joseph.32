🧠 Problem Statement

There is a new alien language that uses the English lowercase letters, but the order of the letters is unknown to you.

You are given a list of words from the alien dictionary, sorted lexicographically according to the rules of this new language.

Your task is to derive the order of the characters in this alien language and return it as a string.

If there is no valid ordering, return an empty string "".
If multiple valid orderings exist, return any one of them.

words = ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]


Output:

"wertf"
