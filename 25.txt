1️⃣ Product of Array Except Self

Concepts: Prefix Product, Suffix Product
Problem:
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all elements of nums except nums[i].
You must solve it without using division and in O(n) time.

Example:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Hint:

Compute prefix products first (product of elements before index i).

Compute suffix products (product of elements after index i).

Multiply prefix[i] * suffix[i].
