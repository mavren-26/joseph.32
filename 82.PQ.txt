🧩 Problem 2 — CPU Job Scheduling
Problem Statement

You are given N jobs, each job has:

id (string)

execution time (integer)

priority (integer; higher = more important)

Jobs must be executed such that:

Higher priority jobs run first

If two jobs have same priority → job with lower execution time goes first

If still tied → lexicographically smaller job id first

You will get Q commands:

"ADD id time priority"

"RUN" → Pop and print job id

"TOP" → Print next job id

"COUNT" → Print number of jobs
