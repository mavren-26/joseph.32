✅ Problem 2: Count the Number of Set Bits from 1 to N

Goal:
For given N, return total number of 1 bits in binary representation of all numbers from 1 to N.

Example:
N = 5
Binary:
1 → 1
2 → 10 (1)
3 → 11 (2)
4 → 100 (1)
5 → 101 (2)
Total = 7

🔥 Bit Trick:

Use formula:

Count bits in ranges of power of 2

Efficient O(log N)
