✅ Problem 1: Minimum Element Stack
Problem Statement

You are given an empty stack that supports the following operations:

push(x) → push element x onto the stack

pop() → remove the top element from the stack

top() → return the top element

getMin() → return the minimum element in the stack at any time

All operations must run in O(1) time.

You need to implement this stack using two stacks:

A normal stack

A "min stack" that always stores the minimum at each level.

Return results of operations in sequence.
