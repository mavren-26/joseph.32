3️⃣ Longest Well-Performing Interval

Concepts: Prefix Sum, HashMap
Problem:
You are given hours worked each day, where hours[i] > 8 is a "tiring day".
Return the length of the longest well-performing interval, where the number of tiring days > non-tiring days.

Example:
Input: hours = [9,9,6,0,6,6,9]
Output: 3
Explanation: [9,9,6] is the longest interval.

Hint:

Convert array to +1 (tiring) and -1 (non-tiring).

Use prefix sum and HashMap to track earliest occurrence.
