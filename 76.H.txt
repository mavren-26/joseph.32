🧩 Problem 2: Longest Subarray With At Most K Distinct Integers
Problem Statement

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

Return the length of the longest contiguous subarray that contains at most k distinct integers.

You must use a sliding window + hash map (frequency map) and solve it in O(n) time.

Constraints

0 <= nums.length <= 10^5

-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

1 <= k <= 10^5

Examples

Example 1

Input: nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: [1, 2, 1, 2] has at most 2 distinct integers.


Example 2

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Any single element subarray is valid.


Example 3

Input: nums = [4, 4, 4, 4], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The whole array is valid.
