🧠 Problem Statement

You are given n tasks labeled from 1 to n.
Each task takes 1 unit of time to complete.

Some tasks have dependencies, meaning that a task cannot start until all its prerequisite tasks have finished.

You can perform multiple tasks in parallel, as long as their dependencies are satisfied.

Your task is to determine the minimum total time required to complete all tasks.

📘 Example 1

Input:

n = 3  
deps = [[1, 3], [2, 3]]


Explanation:

Tasks 1 and 2 can be done in parallel in the first unit of time.

Task 3 depends on both 1 and 2, so it can only start after both are done.

Output:

2
