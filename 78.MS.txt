🟩 Problem 2 — Next Greater Element (Monotonic Stack)
🎯 Problem Statement

Given an array nums of size n, return an array where each element is replaced by the next greater element to its right.
If none exists, replace it with -1.

Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5

Must run in O(n) using a monotonic decreasing stack.

Example
Input:
nums = [2,1,2,4,3]

Output:
[4,2,4,-1,-1]
