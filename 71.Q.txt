Problem Statement

Two runners, A and B, start from opposite ends of a 24-mile straight road.

Runner A runs at 6 miles/hour

Runner B runs at 10 miles/hour

They both start at the same time and run toward each other.

Question

After how many hours will they meet?

How far from A’s starting point will they meet?

Solution Approach

Use formula:

Relative Speed = Speed₁ + Speed₂ (since they move toward each other)

Distance covered = Total distance
Time = Distance / Relative Speed
