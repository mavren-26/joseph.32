🧩 Problem 1: Lowest Common Ancestor in a BST

Concepts: BST property, recursion
Statement:
Given a BST and two nodes p and q, find their lowest common ancestor (LCA).
The LCA of two nodes is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants.

Example:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8  
Output: 6
