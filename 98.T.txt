⭐ Problem 2 (Medium): Word Count With a Prefix
Description

Insert words into a Trie.
Implement countPrefix(prefix) → return how many words start with this prefix.

Example

Words: ["apple", "app", "apt", "bat", "ball"]

countPrefix("ap") → 3

countPrefix("ba") → 2

Concept

Each node stores:

count → number of words passing through that node
